        <p><b>Maize Harvest Income and Saving Calculator</b></p>
        <p>This Python program helps farmers calculate their income and savings from maize harvests. By entering the number of bags, price per bag, and the percentage they want to save, the program shows total income, savings, and the balance left.
          <br>It also gives feedback: if the income is below GHS 500, it encourages the farmer to improve, but if it is higher, it congratulates them. This project is useful because it applies basic programming skills to a real-life problem while promoting savings and financial planning.</p>

        <p><b>Online Student Register Form </b></p>
        <p>The Online Student Registration Form is a web-based project created using HTML and CSS. It is designed to collect important details from students who want to register for online classes. The form includes fields for entering a studentâ€™s name, age, email, and phone number. It also provides options to select gender, choose preferred subjects such as Maths, Physics, Chemistry, and S.T.E.M, and give reasons for joining the classes through a text area.
          <br>To make the form more user-friendly, CSS is used for styling. Labels are styled in white for clear visibility, and input fields are given padding, rounded corners, and a clean layout. The subjects are displayed as checkboxes in a neat vertical order, while the submit button is styled with a colorful gradient and a hover effect, making the form interactive and attractive.
          <br>This project is useful because it shows how HTML and CSS can be combined to create simple but practical applications. It can be applied in schools and online platforms to gather student information in an organized and efficient way.</p>
